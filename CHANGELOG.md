  publishing this bugfix build.

## [0.24.1]

### Changed
- **Release Preparation:** Added a concise checklist in the README and expanded guidance in the Technical Manual so maintainers
  can confidently run through documentation reviews and release packaging steps for minor updates.
- **Documentation Review:** Refreshed the Markdown manuals to ensure their instructions and terminology match the current
  application experience prior to publishing this release.

## [0.24.0]

### Added
- **Frameless Window Design:** Implemented a modern, VSCode-inspired frameless window with a custom title bar for dragging and custom window controls (minimize, maximize, close).
- **Dedicated Menu Bar:** Created a new menu bar below the title bar to house primary application actions ("New Repo", "Check Updates") and view navigation, creating a cleaner and more organized layout.

### Changed

### Changed
- **Code Cleanup:** Removed the experimental "Drag & Drop Strategy" setting and all associated debug code, simplifying the implementation and improving maintainability.

## [0.16.0]

### Added
- **Project Intelligence Engine:** The repository configuration screen now automatically detects the project type (e.g., Node.js, Python, Delphi, Lazarus) by analyzing its file structure. It then provides buttons to generate common, pre-configured tasks like "Install Dependencies" or "CI Checks & Build", specific to the detected technology.
- **Advanced Task Steps:** Added a rich set of new, specific task steps for different ecosystems, including:
  - **Node.js:** Install, Lint, Format, Type Check, Test, Build.
  - **Python:** Create Venv, Install Deps, Lint, Format, Type Check, Test, Build.

## [0.10.0]

### Added
- **Executable Path Configuration:** In Settings > Behavior, you can now specify the exact path to the `git` and `svn` executables. This makes the application more robust for users who do not have these tools in their system's default `PATH`.
- **Executable Path Helpers:** The new configuration section includes buttons to:
    - **Auto-detect:** Automatically find the executable if it's in the `PATH`.
    - **Browse:** Open a file picker to locate the executable manually.
    - **Test:** Verify that the specified path is valid and works correctly.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where GitHub release information was not consistently shown for all repositories. The application now correctly fetches the latest available release, including pre-releases.

## [0.9.0]

### Added
- **GitHub Release Integration (Phase 1):** The dashboard now displays the latest GitHub release information directly on each repository card, including the version tag and status badges for "Published," "Pre-release," or "Draft." This requires a GitHub Personal Access Token to be configured in the settings.

## [0.8.1]

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL:** Fixed a crash (React error #310) that occurred when opening the "Customize Color" modal for a category. This was caused by a violation of the Rules of Hooks.
- Fixed several TypeScript type errors related to event handlers in the Dashboard component, improving code stability.

## [0.2.2]

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL:** Fixed a major bug where `settings.json` was deleted during an auto-update, causing all user settings and repositories to be lost. The application now correctly stores all user data in the standard persistent user data directory. A one-time migration process has been added to automatically move existing settings for users updating from older versions.

## [0.2.1]

### Added
- **Configurable Auto-Updates:** Added a setting to enable or disable checking for pre-release versions.
- **Configurable Browser:** Added a setting to choose which browser (System Default, Chrome, or Firefox) is used to open web links.

  - **Branch Management:** A new "Branches" tab in the repository configuration view allows users to view, create, delete (local and remote), and merge Git branches.
  - **Branch Switching:** A dropdown menu has been added to repository cards to quickly view and switch between local and remote branches.
  - **Commit History Viewer:** A new "History" tab in the repository configuration view displays recent commits. A new "History" button on the repository card provides quick access to this information in a modal.
- **Parallel Task Execution:** Tasks on different repositories can now run concurrently, each in its own process. The UI can handle multiple "processing" states at once.

### Fixed
- **Branch Switching Ambiguity:** The branch switcher now correctly handles repositories with multiple remotes and branches of the same name by displaying the full remote path (e.g., `origin/main`) and using a more precise `git checkout --track` command.

## [0.1.4]

### Changed
- **UI Compactness:** Significantly reduced padding, margins, and component sizes across the application to create a more compact, data-dense interface. This affects the Header, Dashboard, Repository Cards, Configuration Views, Log Panel, and Settings.
