# Git Automation Dashboard 0.27.0 Release Notes

## Summary
Git Automation Dashboard 0.27.0 introduces a full Workflow Template Explorer so you can curate, edit, validate, and ship GitHub Actions pipelines without leaving the Repo Form. Supporting updates polish the branch toolbar, tighten commit history formatting, stabilize the releases tab layout, and harden the Windows packaging workflow by validating manifest hashes after normalization.

## What's Changed

### Workflow Template Explorer (#111)
- Added a dedicated **CI** tab that lists every `.github/workflows` file, surfaces timestamps, and keeps unsaved state visible while you edit YAML inline.
- Surfaced curated template recommendations (with tags and badges) alongside a drag-resizable pane so you can fork a starting point, rename it, and create new workflow files in one flow.
- Connected Save, Validate, and Commit & Push actions to the Electron bridge so you can persist edits, run `yamllint`/`act` validation, and publish commits without leaving the modal.

### Branch & History UX (#109, #110)
- Rebalanced the Git branch toolbar so destructive actions stay on one row while routing feedback through the shared status bar, keeping warnings legible even on narrow windows.
- Cleaned up commit history formatting by trimming phantom whitespace and aligning metadata, improving readability for long commit lists.

### Release & Packaging Reliability (#108, #107)
- Fixed the releases tab layout so the list and editor sections share the viewport predictably, preventing scroll traps while editing notes.
- Taught the Windows artifact normalization script to recompute SHA512 hashes after renaming installers, added regression tests, and stopped publishing builds when manifest entries drift.

### Validation Fixes (#111)
- Bound the CI validator to the correct IPC sender so the Validate button reliably streams `yamllint`/`act` output back to the log console.

## Breaking Changes
- None. This release is backwards compatible.

## Upgrade Notes
1. Install `yamllint` or `act` locally to take advantage of the CI tab's validation workflow before committing edited YAML.
2. Continue running `node electron/scripts/normalize-win32-artifacts.mjs` after `npm run pack`; the script now enforces manifest hash parity and will fail fast when mismatches occur.
