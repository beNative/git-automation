# Git Automation Dashboard 0.26.0 Release Notes

## Summary
Git Automation Dashboard 0.26.0 introduces Git branch maintenance shortcuts alongside expanded structured logging so operators can prune stale remotes, clean merged branches, and audit every configuration change with clear diagnostics. UI refinements keep the repository form compact, and the browser demo now mirrors the new APIs for walkthroughs.

## What's Changed

### Git Branch Maintenance
- Added **Prune Remotes** and **Clean Local Branches** buttons to the repository form, wiring them to new Electron IPC handlers that execute the corresponding Git commands and refresh repository state automatically. ([#101](https://github.com/beNative/git-automation/pull/101))

### Observability & Logging
- Instrumented the Repo Form modal, branch actions, and Repo Edit view with structured logging so maintenance operations, release edits, and configuration saves emit consistent telemetry to the debug console and log files. ([#102](https://github.com/beNative/git-automation/pull/102), [#103](https://github.com/beNative/git-automation/pull/103), [#104](https://github.com/beNative/git-automation/pull/104))

### UI & Developer Experience
- Tightened padding across the repository form to fit dense workflows without excessive scrolling. ([#99](https://github.com/beNative/git-automation/pull/99), [#100](https://github.com/beNative/git-automation/pull/100))
- Updated the About dialog copy and controls to match the streamlined layout. ([#97](https://github.com/beNative/git-automation/pull/97))
- Expanded the in-browser demo stubs to simulate project intelligence, branch maintenance, and release APIs so product demos reflect the latest capabilities. ([#101](https://github.com/beNative/git-automation/pull/101))

### Bug Fixes
- Restored repository save reliability while automation tasks are running. ([#98](https://github.com/beNative/git-automation/pull/98))
- Ensured Windows manifest normalization refreshes checksums so automatic updates detect the latest installers. ([#96](https://github.com/beNative/git-automation/pull/96))
- Resolved a duplicate logger declaration that caused Repo Form symbol conflicts. ([#105](https://github.com/beNative/git-automation/pull/105))

## Breaking Changes
- None. This release is backwards compatible.

## Upgrade Notes
1. Encourage maintainers to run the new **Prune Remotes** and **Clean Local Branches** actions after fetching branches to keep dashboards tidy before packaging a release.
2. Continue running `node electron/scripts/normalize-win32-artifacts.mjs` after `npm run pack` so the refreshed manifest metadata is captured before uploading installers.
