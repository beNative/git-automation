# Git Automation Dashboard 0.25.9 Release Notes

## Summary
Git Automation Dashboard 0.25.9 focuses on tightening the release pipeline so packaged builds always ship with the updater metadata that desktop clients expect. It also enhances the auto-update diagnostics surfaced to operators when GitHub responds with unexpected errors.

## What's Changed

### Release Workflow Improvements
- Added `electron/scripts/normalize-win32-artifacts.mjs` so maintainers can rewrite 32-bit Windows installer filenames to the `-win32-` convention and automatically emit `latest-win32.yml` before publishing. This prevents updater lookups from missing the 32-bit manifest.
- Updated the `main` GitHub Actions workflow to execute the normalization script during Windows builds and to fail the job whenever no `latest*.yml` manifests are produced. This guards against accidentally promoting builds that cannot self-update. ([#94](https://github.com/beNative/git-automation/pull/94))

### Auto-Update Diagnostics
- Expanded the GitHub provider fallback to log sanitized API payload summaries, making it easier to correlate REST retries with upstream behavior during incident response.
- Refined the update error toast so engineers see concise HTTP status messaging and are alerted when release manifests are missing, while longer payloads are redirected to the debug log. ([#94](https://github.com/beNative/git-automation/pull/94))

## Breaking Changes
- None. This release is backwards compatible.

## Upgrade Notes
1. After running `npm run pack`, execute `node electron/scripts/normalize-win32-artifacts.mjs` to produce the 32-bit manifest before drafting the GitHub release.
2. Verify that CI reports all `latest*.yml` files before promoting the release; failed checks indicate the updater would not see the build.

## Acknowledgements
